## 🔑 Permissions

The app requires camera permissions to scan QR codes. The first time you open the app, you'll be prompted to grant camera access. Without this permission, the scanning feature won't work.

If permission is not granted, you will see a button to request camera access. Once granted, you will be able to start scanning QR codes right away! 🎉

---

## 📱 Features

- **Camera Access Request**: If the app doesn't have permission to access the camera, it will ask you to grant it.
- **QR Code Scanning**: Once camera access is granted, you can scan QR codes to retrieve information.
- **Simple Interface**: The app has a minimal and clean user interface to ensure a seamless experience.

## 🌐 Technologies Used

- **React Native** – For building cross-platform mobile apps.
- **Expo** – Framework for building and deploying React Native apps.
